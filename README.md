ChoreChamp is a React-based web application that gamifies household chores, making task management fun and rewarding.
The app allows users to create and manage chores, embark on missions, earn points, and redeem rewards.
With its intuitive interface and engaging features, ChoreChamp transforms mundane household tasks into exciting challenges.
The app consists of two separate repositories: one for the Front-End and another for the Back-End API. In order to run this 
front-end application, the back-end api must be installed and running. Follow this [link](https://github.com/Msambere/chore-app-backend) and complete the back-end setup 
before continuing.

## Data Flow

The ChoreChamp application follows a client-server architecture with the React frontend communicating with a backend API. 
Here's an overview of the data flow:

1. User Authentication:
   - User submits login credentials
   - Frontend sends a request to the backend API
   - Backend validates credentials and returns user data
   - Frontend stores user data in state and local storage

2. Chore Management:
   - User creates/edits/deletes a chore
   - Frontend sends API request with chore data
   - Backend processes the request and updates the database
   - Frontend updates local state with the response

3. Mission Flow:
   - User starts a mission
   - Frontend requests mission creation from the backend
   - Backend generates mission chores and returns data
   - Frontend displays active mission and tracks progress
   - As user completes chores, frontend sends updates to backend
   - Backend calculates points and updates mission status

4. Reward Redemption:
   - User selects a reward to redeem
   - Frontend sends redemption request to backend
   - Backend verifies points and processes redemption
   - Frontend updates user's point balance and reward status
